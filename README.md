Problem Statement - 
	Being in the current pandemic situation how to we know our chances of getting the threat? Altough in this current tensed situation we still need to move out to get some basic essentials procurement, so how do we do that with minimal possible risk of getting affected?
	
Solution - 

By social contribution we procure each person's travel data, using which we can estimate the risk a person has of  
getting affected by the current pandemic which we are facing. Which doesn't stop there but further proceeds to guide us for the minimal time which we move out, we ensure that we are at minimal risk of getting affected.
